# SFWR2XB3_SpellChecker
Java Spell Check client made for SFWR 2XB3 at McMaster University

By Josh Hu, Nick Lago, Connor Sheehan

The project was assigned as a Final Assignment for Sofwtare Engineering 2XB3, an experiential learning course about software engineering
practices and binding theory to those practices. The application required the use of algorithms learned in SFWR 2C03 as well as design techniques learned in SFWR 2AA4. We used Red-Black BST's, Ternary Search Tries and Heapsort. Use of a data set was also required, we chose a 650,000 word dictionary.
